## Abstract

We live surrounded by electronic devices of increasing complexity. These devices usually have a short lifetime and a high environmental impact. How can we, from the maker movement and fablabs, contribute to reducing the waste of resources they produce? What role should we play as technologists in such a “resource-consuming” environment?
We will describe how within a collaborative environment and with minimal technological resources, a multitude of electronic devices (or furniture, or clothing, or vehicles) can be repaired, improved, and reused. A fablab can be a truly circular economy node, where material resources pass through until they find their return to the utility cycle. With fablab resources, not only you “can make almost anything”, but you can redesign and make improved parts to continue using already available items and materials.


### Design/methodology/approach

First, we describe what we consider to be good uses of material resources in a fablab, from design to manufacturing, including sources of waste materials that can be reused. We will also describe the main repairs and maintenance that we must carry out on the machines, common to many fablabs. This way we are achieving a considerable amount of circularity and sustainability.
The knowledge to repair an electronic device is valuable since it allows studying real problems by analyzing their causes (technical) and consequences (environmental and economic). We give several examples of educational uses of appliance repair: from workshops for curious people, within global networks such as Repair Cafe, to official subjects for engineering degree students, within the University of Extremadura. 

Finally we describe how a regional company, La Hormiga Verde, in Spain, has based its business model on a collection network for all types of electrical materials. They are repaired and sold, or destroyed and separated by personnel at risk of social exclusion. Fablabs can collaborate very well with this type of company since we can help to further value the materials they generate through the process of design and manufacturing of new products.

### Data/sample

The reflections collected here are the result of work within a public higher education and research institution, the University of Extremadura, in Spain, which allows us to be in contact with very varied advances and experts; we are globally active and collaborate with dozens of companies and research groups. We believe that our vision can be extrapolated to many other places. It is a daily experience to discover how state-of-the-art resources from institutions and companies are barely used and, despite this, fiercely protected, causing a clear waste of resources. This motivated us to promote from 2014 a development community, Smart Open Lab (SOL), which later became a fablab, based on shared resources and open knowledge. Uniting different departments, research groups, companies, and people, we have been doing a job of redefining and reusing resources that motivates the writing of this article. In particular, we will focus on the problem of electronic waste and its possible revaluation, both economically and academically.

### Findings

We discovered that fablabs, as spaces for the design and development of solutions, should play an important role in this field in at least three different ways, in which we take part:
1 – Being an example of self-sustainability, disseminating how to improve, maintain and repair their facilities.
2 – Being a common storage and distribution point for components and materials, which are waiting to be reintroduced to the value chain.
3 – Being a place of training on technological, formal, and informal self-sufficiency.

We will describe each of these three points in the paper's chapters, leaving collaboration with waste management companies for the last one. 

This article is strongly based on the author's experience with the coordination of the fablab Smart Open Lab, which manages some 400 m2, divided into 8 spaces, much machinery, and thousands of components. It is essential to say that the most important good in SOL is the more than 200 people associated each year. Very diverse people contribute to improving both the spaces and the community itself every day.

We advocate for accessible fablab models, based on trust in people.
Unfortunately this also limits the scope and applicability of part of the solutions, since other fablabs have other management models or less possibility of access, or storage, of materials.

### Practical implications

The article is intended to be a short guide to good practices for the use and maintenance of materials in fablabs and makerspaces, with an emphasis on electronic components. This produces in the community both savings in material and environmental costs, as well as an improvement in education and awareness. It also makes us active participants in local and global networks that promote legislative and customary changes.

Original value of paper – What is new in the paper? State the value of the paper and to whom.
The article exposes technical, administrative, and teaching experiences that have been and can be applied in various spaces. The proposal of the article aims to collect and particularize these experiences to an active fablab within a relatively small public university, but with a strong community of users around.

### Context

It is sad to know that humanity's level of waste generation is excessive. The consumption of resources, given the reduction in production and distribution costs, is leading the environment to a situation of great imbalance. Both from the point of view of extracted minerals or felled trees destroying environments, and from the point of view of pollution allowed by ecosystems, we are exceeding ecological critical points. This destroys biodiversity, natural and cultural heritage. In addition, materials are being dispersed around the planet that, when concentrated, are very harmful to the environment, but that, when properly managed, are very suitable for human use, such as plastics, textile waste, mercury, lithium or lead. Since life has existed on the planet, the residue of some can become the wealth of others.
We will begin by saying that in the 21st century we can already find collection, repair and reuse networks that are responsible for their environment and their community, as we will describe later. Unfortunately, we must remember that most waste, and even more so electronic waste, does not reach a correct reintroduction into the production chain, but instead ends up in the hands of opaque organizations in impoverished countries without adequate environmental protection systems. There are many documentaries and articles about it, related to planned obsolescence and illegal waste traffic. It doesn't surprise us; every day we see how more and more devices are discarded even when they are working; the chain of unbridled consumerism continues; it's easier to buy a new device than to fix a used one; we run a comfortable smoke screen that hides the environmental cost.
