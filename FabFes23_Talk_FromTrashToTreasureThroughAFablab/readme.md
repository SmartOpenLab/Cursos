**Conference talk**

Presentation of the talk delivered in "FabFest 23 – Designing Relisient Futures" at Thimphu, Bhutan, July 2023, by Antonio Gordillo Guerrero (anto@unex.es).

**Abstract**

We are surrounded by huge amounts of apparently only one-use things: furniture, electronics, clothes, plastics... They are designed not to last much: low-quality parts, difficulties to repair or maintain, lack of replacements, software obsolescence, etc. Too many valuable goods and materials finish their life in a sad way: buried or burned.

As designers and producers of goods, we have a double responsibility: first, we must design practical and durable objects, being responsible with our sources of materials; second, we can fix many things using open knowledge and materials recovered from the trash.

We will provide many examples of environmentally positive actions inside our fablab, Smart Open Lab, where we make intensive use of “abandoned” materials. Our actions are possible because of a large community with a strong philosophy of sharing around the fablab installations. A large community implies a rich tree of relationships that make us quite aware of different companies, institutions, and people who discard many useful materials. Also, we have constant and fruitful relationships with waste management companies. This way, we have become quite active point of Circular Economy, where discarded materials pass through the fablab to return to the “usefulness cycle”.

To concrete, repairing electronics, or software problems, we are not only able the be quite self-sustainable with our installations, but we are a point of Education around reparation. Both in formal and informal ways, in regional and global networks.

Recovering unused tables, chairs, shelves or laminated materials from institutions, companies or associated people, we have provided safe and useful furniture for our own installations. They include now: three “hard” workshops, three ”soft” workshops, one painting room, one office space and two acoustically conditioned rooms for audio recording. 99% of our furniture was saved from trash.

In our opinion, a space to do “almost” anything must have “almost” every possible material. So we need to be able to get, and properly store, it. We get many times our materials from wastes or cutoffs from regional industries: metal, wood, construction, leather... Most of our machines can work with cutoffs. It increases the operation time and increases error probability but definitively saves environmental cost.

Finally we will explain how we relate with waste management companies in our region, which can be a very good partners. They provides us with valuable materials while we can get rid of our wastes in a responsible way.
